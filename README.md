# Mentorship

Here I examine the data provided by the authors of this paper:

AlShebli B, Makovi K, Rahwan T. The association between early career informal mentorship in academic collaborations and junior author performance. Nat Commun. 2020 Nov 17;11(1):5855. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19723-8. PMID: 33203848. <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33203848/>

The input data are from the 'bedoor/Mentorship' GitHub repository at

<https://github.com/bedoor/Mentorship>

Their repository is described as:

'This repository includes all data used in "The Association between Early Career Informal Mentorship in Academic Collaborations and Junior Author Performance".'

As their data file is large, it is not included in this repository.
